# Kaggle-Competion-Clean-vs-Dirty
This program classifies if a plate cleaned or dirty in the competition Clean vs Dirty on the Kaggle. The main difficulty of this competition was thing that there were few training data(only 20 cleaned and 20 dirty plates). My best private score was 0.92322. The metric for that competition was accuracy.
